# llgenie

Tooling to serve GGUF models locally via **llama.cpp's `llama-server`** (Metal / 48 GB
unified-memory M-series Mac), plus a resilient Hugging Face downloader and the Python
venv scaffold needed to run them.

This repo bundles three pieces that were built and validated together:

| Piece | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **GGUF launcher + auto-tuner** | `scripts/llama_serve.py` | Scan `~/models/**/*.gguf`, pick a model, auto-tune `llama-server` flags to fit 48 GB unified memory, and serve an OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `127.0.0.1:11434`. |
| **HF downloader** | `scripts/hf_download.py` | Download a GGUF into a tiered models folder with live progress and auto-resume/auto-retry against a throttled Hugging Face CDN. |
| **venv setup** | `tools/` | `gguf`-tooling environment (Python 3.10 venv + pip-compile container), recreatable via `make venv-install`. |

---

## Requirements

- **macOS** with an Apple Silicon GPU (tuned for 48 GB unified memory; edit the constants
  in `scripts/llama_serve.py` for less).
- **llama.cpp** built with Metal support, producing `build/bin/llama-server`. The launcher
  finds it as **`llama-server` on your PATH** (see *Install* — `make install` symlinks it
  into `~/bin`). It terminates with a clear error if the binary is missing.
- **Python 3.10** (Homebrew: `brew install python@3.10`) for the `gguf` tooling venv.
- Optional `hf` CLI (Hugging Face hub) in a venv — used by `scripts/hf_download.py`.

---

## Install (recommended) — one command, no manual venv work

```bash
git clone <this-repo> ~/repository/git/llgenie
cd ~/repository/git/llgenie
make install
```

`make install` does the whole setup so you never touch the venv by hand:

1. **venv** — builds the Python 3.10 gguf-tooling venv at `~/llama-gguf-tools/.venv`
   (`numpy` + `gguf==0.19.0` + `huggingface_hub[cli]` so the `hf` downloader used by
   `--download-top-tier` is always available, no separate install needed).
2. **launcher** — writes an executable `~/bin/llgenie` that runs `scripts/llama_serve.py` **with the
   venv's python**, so `gguf`/`numpy` resolve with zero extra steps.
3. **`llama-server` on PATH** — symlinks `~/bin/llama-server` → your llama.cpp
   `build/bin/llama-server` (override the build path with `LLAMA_SERVER_BIN=<path>`).
   `scripts/llama_serve.py` resolves the server as **`llama-server` on PATH** and **terminates with a
   clear error if it isn't found**.
4. **symlink + smoke** — symlinks `~/bin/llgenie.py` → this repo's launcher (`scripts/llama_serve.py`),
   then runs `~/bin/llgenie --list`. Succeeds even when `~/models` is empty (you populate it with
   `llgenie --download-top-tier`), failing only on a genuine gguf/launch error.

After `make install`, just run:

```bash
llgenie                 # interactive model picker
llgenie --list          # list models
llgenie qwen            # launch by model-name substring
llgenie --dry qwen      # print the tuned command without running
```

Other targets: `make venv-install`, `make link`, `make smoke`, `make list`,
`make version`, `make uninstall` (removes the launcher + symlink, keeps the venv), `make help`.

> **Why a wrapper?** `scripts/llama_serve.py` imports the `gguf`/`numpy` packages that live in the
> venv, so it must be launched with the venv python. The `~/bin/llgenie` wrapper does
> exactly that; the `llgenie.py` symlink keeps editors/`--list` pointing at the real file (which lives at
> `scripts/llama_serve.py`).

### Manual setup (only if you don't want `make install`)

```bash
# 1. venv
cd tools && make venv-install      # create ~/llama-gguf-tools/.venv + install deps
# 2. run with the venv python
~/llama-gguf-tools/.venv/bin/python scripts/llama_serve.py --list
```

`requirements.in` is the single source of truth; `requirements.txt` is generated with
`pip-compile` inside the `tools/` Dockerfile container (`make generate-requirements`).

## Which llama.cpp build is used (card-size rule, issue #84)

`make install` picks the llama.cpp **source tree** and the **backend** from the
hardware — it clones-or-pulls the chosen tree to its **latest commit** and builds
it; it never symlinks a stale prebuilt.

### Tree selection — card RAM only (no model quant inspection)
Card RAM means the GPU's VRAM when an NVIDIA card is present (via `nvidia-smi`),
otherwise the system RAM. `LLAMA_RAM_BYTES` is a test/CI seam, not a user knob.

| Card RAM | Tree to build | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 8 GB  | **Prism** | only low-bit PTQ1_0 fits; stock can't load it |
| 12 GB | **Prism** | PTQ1_0 fits; stock can't load it |
| 16 GB | **Prism** | PQ2_0/PTQ1_0 fit; stock can't load them |
| 24 GB | **Prism** | Q4_K fits; Prism runs low-bit AND standard quants |
| 48 GB | **upstream** | Q8_0 fits; stock handles it |
| 64 GB | **upstream** | Q8_0/F16 fits; stock handles it |

The threshold is inclusive on the low side: **card_RAM <= 24 GB -> Prism, > 24 GB -> upstream**
(single constant `PRISM_THRESHOLD_GB = 24` in `scripts/detect_server.py`).

Prism (PrismML-Eng/llama.cpp, branch `prism`) is a **superset** of stock upstream:
it loads every standard quant PLUS the low-bit PTQ1_0/PQ2_0/TQ1_0/TQ2_0 that only it supports.

### Backend selection (hardware)
Metal (macOS + Apple Silicon) · CUDA (nvidia-smi lists a GPU AND nvcc is present) · CPU (fallback).

### Explicit variant targets (host: build ONE variant)
```
make install                 # auto-detects tree+backend for THIS card, builds it
make build-variant TREE=prism BACKEND=cpu     # build just one variant (CI uses these)
make build-variant TREE=upstream BACKEND=cuda
make install-prism-cpu       # build+install one tree+backend in isolation
make install-prism-cuda      # (needs nvcc)
make install-prism-metal     # (macOS only)
make install-upstream-cpu
make install-upstream-cuda   # (needs nvcc)
make install-upstream-metal  # (macOS only)
make uninstall               # removes launcher + symlinks AND the cloned tree dirs
```

### Env seams (CI/test)
- `LLAMA_BACKEND` = metal | cuda | cpu  (override hardware detection)
- `LLAMA_RAM_BYTES` = card RAM in bytes (test/CI seam)
- `LLAMA_SERVER_TREE` = prism | upstream (force the tree, independent of card RAM)

### CI matrix (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
Two **parallel** jobs build and verify every variant, each self-contained
(own tree dir + per-backend build dir so variants never collide):

- `server-variants` (**ubuntu-latest**, CUDA+python image): builds `prism+cpu`,
  `prism+cuda`, `upstream+cpu`, `upstream+cuda`. The CUDA toolkit is installed
  before the CUDA builds; every variant verifies `--version` + `--help` (exit 0),
  the CUDA variants additionally assert `ldd` links cuda runtime libs, and the
  CPU variants run the 0.5B `"hi"` health check (`scripts/ci_health.py`).
- `server-variants-mac` (**macos-14**, Apple Silicon): builds `prism+metal`,
  `prism+cpu`, `upstream+metal`, `upstream+cpu`. Metal is Apple-only and can
  only be built here; every variant verifies `--version` + `--help`, and the CPU
  variants run the 0.5B `"hi"` health check. The job installs **bash 5** and
  **python 3.10** via Homebrew and prepends them to `PATH` (macOS ships bash 3.2,
  which lacks `set -o pipefail`/`[[ ]]`, and the gguf venv needs python 3.10).


## Download a model (`scripts/hf_download.py`)

```bash
python3 scripts/hf_download.py <repo_id> <filename> <dest_dir> <label>
```

- Reads `HF_TOKEN` from `~/.zshrc` at runtime (never stored in the repo).
- Sets `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 HF_HUB_DISABLE_XET=1` for speed.
- Auto-retries (up to 20 attempts), resuming the partial file on dropped connections.
- Appends a `.progress.log` next to the destination for live monitoring.

**Example:**

```bash
python3 scripts/hf_download.py Qwen/Qwen3.5-24B-GGUF qwen3.5-24b-q5_k_m.gguf ~/models/Qwen/24GB qwen-q5
```

## 3. Launch a model (`scripts/llama_serve.py`)

Run with the tooling venv's Python so `gguf`/`numpy` are importable:

```bash
~/llama-gguf-tools/.venv/bin/python scripts/llama_serve.py --list     # list models, don't run
~/llama-gguf-tools/.venv/bin/python scripts/llama_serve.py <name>     # run by substring
~/llama-gguf-tools/.venv/bin/python scripts/llama_serve.py            # interactive picker
~/llama-gguf-tools/.venv/bin/python scripts/llama_serve.py --dry qwen # print the command, don't run
```

The launcher will:

- Scan `~/models/**/*.gguf` (fast header-only metadata read for large files).
- Auto-tune the server: context sized to RAM budget minus KV-cache/OS overhead, `-ngl 99`
  (all layers to Metal), `-fa` flash attention, q4_0 KV cache, `--cont-batching`,
  `--metrics`.
- Detect reasoning-capable models from the chat template and enable `--reasoning` /
  `--reasoning-format deepseek` so thoughts are preserved in `message.reasoning_content`.
- Serve **one model at a time**: any existing `llama-server` on the port is stopped before
  launch. Default port `11434`, override with `--port`.
- Serve under a **stable alias `llm-local`** (`--alias llm-local`) so OpenAI-compatible
  clients can pin one endpoint name regardless of which model is loaded.
- Write the exact command to `<model-dir>/.run.log` for audit/replay.

You can customize `TOTAL_RAM_BYTES`, `OS_OVERHEAD`, `KV_QUANT`, and `SAMPLING` at the top
of `scripts/llama_serve.py`. For `--download-top-tier`, the fit is **dynamic**: the total
comes from the actual card (`LLAMA_RAM_BYTES` overrides it), headroom is capped at 45% of
total, and KV reserve applies automatically.

### Test the endpoint

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"llm-local","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

## Download the top-tier trending models that fit your GPU (`--download-top-tier`)

Discover and download the **currently-trending, top-tier** GGUF models (from the Hugging
Face community that publishes GGUF for llama.cpp) that **fit the CPU/GPU card you actually
have** — with KV-cache headroom so they *run*, not just download.

```bash
# list the top-tier trending models that fit the actual card (no download)
llgenie --download-top-tier --list
# download 5 distinct providers x 2 quants (default): each provider's HIGH (Q8) + lower (Q6/Q5)
llgenie --download-top-tier
# download N providers' high + lower quants (--count) 
llgenie --download-top-tier --count 3
# just the best (high) quant per provider, no lower
llgenie --download-top-tier --per-provider 1
# only consider models rated high enough (trendingScore floor)
llgenie --download-top-tier --min-trending-score 150
# see what it would download without downloading
llgenie --download-top-tier --dry
```

By default it aims for **5 distinct providers × 2 quants each** — the HIGH (Q8) plus a clearly-LOWER
(Q4/Q5/Q6) quant per provider — **ranked by trending** (most popular now first, not by file size),
and it **only downloads — it never auto-starts llama-server** (serve a downloaded model separately
with `llgenie <name>`). A failing provider is retried (up to 3×) without aborting the batch, and
already-downloaded models are never re-fetched on a re-run (idempotent via HF content-hash). Live
download progress shows a **0-100%** readout of the current file, and it uses HF's high-performance
`hf-xet` transfer (fast for large files).

How it decides "trending + top tier + fits":

- **Trending** — a time-weighted Hugging Face popularity signal (`trendingScore`,
  `filter=gguf`), so you get what's hot *now*, not a lifetime download count.
- **Top tier** — only flagship/large popular families (Qwen3, DeepSeek, Mistral, Llama,
  Gemma, gpt-oss, Phi, QwQ, GLM, Olmo, plus trending additions Ornith/Qwopus/Qwythos/
  Tiel-Coder/MiniMax/K2 so popular trending LLMs aren't dropped), and only non-trivial
  quant files (no sub‑1B toy quants, no multi-file shards, no vision projectors) — plus
  it drops **low-fidelity IQ1/IQ2/IQ3 quants** (an 8-11 GB "27B" is poor quality) and
  **MTP/mtp-* companion heads** (multi-token-prediction aux files, not the serviceable
  model), and still excludes non-LLM repos (TTS, image/audio encoders).
- **Fits with buffer** — the total memory comes from the **actual card** at runtime
  (`sysctl hw.memsize` on macOS, `/proc/meminfo` on Linux, or `LLAMA_RAM_BYTES`), with
  current-pressure headroom (`vm_stat`). Only models that leave a KV-cache reserve are
  offered — on a 48 GB card that's ~29 GB Q8-class 27B models; on a 16 GB CPU card it
  downshifts to ~12 GB Q3-class.

Downloads go into a **provider-aware** folder so you always know who made the model, and the
downloaded file is **verified by its GGUF metadata** (architecture / name / layers) before it's
accepted — an HTML error page, truncated/corrupt stub, or wrong-model-under-right-name is rejected:

```
~/models/<owner>/<family>/<TierGB>/<file>.gguf
~/models/unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B/48GB/Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q8_K_XL.gguf
```

The `TierGB` folder is **dynamic and bounded by the card that runs the model** — it's the
smallest available bucket ≥ the model size, from a growing ladder (1/2/4/8/16/24/48/96/128/
192/256/384/512/...), where only buckets ≤ the detected/overridden card exist. So a **48 GB
card keeps the classic 8/16/24/48** folders (plus truthful 1/2/4 small tiers), a **small
CPU/container card gets truthful 1/2/4/8 folders** for tiny models, and a **256/512 GB card
also gains large tiers** and labels a 400 GB model `512GB/` (never misleadingly `48GB/`):

```
48 GB card:  29GB -> 48GB/   47GB -> 48GB/   0.43GB -> 1GB/   (truthful small tiers)
8 GB card:   0.5B -> 1GB/   1.5B -> 2GB/    3B/7B -> 4GB/    (real CPU/container models)
512 GB card: 60GB -> 96GB/  100GB -> 128GB/  400GB -> 512GB/
```

Re-runs are **idempotent**: the real `hf` (huggingface_hub) CLI content-addresses its cache
by etag, and the launcher skips entirely when the target file is already complete — so you
never re-download the whole model.

**Only listed are models that can actually download.** Before the batch commits, every
candidate is **pre-flight probed**: `--download-top-tier` fetches a real ~64 KiB chunk of
each file (a ranged request) and verifies it is genuine GGUF data over an authenticated 200
— so **gated (403/401 "requires approval")**, **dead (404)**, and **200-but-HTML/error-shell**
repos are **skipped fast** (one cheap probe, not 3 slow failed downloads) and logged clearly:
`[top-tier] skipping <repo>::<file>: access-denied (403)`. The list is then **refilled from
the next fitting provider**, so the requested `--count × --per-provider` total is honored even
when some trending repos are unreachable — no more silent "8 of the intended 10". The final
report shows `downloaded N/M (+S skipped: access-denied, dead)`.

### Scope to ONE model family (`--download-top-tier --family <keyword>`)

`--family <keyword>` narrows the same top-tier pipeline to the **top `--count`
providers (HF owners) of ONE model family** (e.g. `qwen`, `ornith`) — each with
its HIGH (Q8) + LOWER (Q4/Q5/Q6) quant — instead of trending across *all*
families. A niche family has 0–2 repos in the global trending window, so this
queries the **complete** family for the keyword rather than the trending slice.

```bash
# top 5 providers of the qwen family, each with high + lower quants
llgenie --download-top-tier --family qwen
# top 1 provider of the ornith family, just the high quant
llgenie --download-top-tier --family ornith --count 1 --per-provider 1
# preview a known low-end family, 1 provider, without downloading (small card)
LLAMA_RAM_BYTES=$((8*1024**3)) llgenie --download-top-tier --family qwen --count 1 --dry
```

Everything else (`--count`, `--per-provider`, `--dry`, placement, probe+refill,
`hf` download) works exactly as the trending path — family mode is a *filter*
fed into the **same** pipeline, not a second implementation:

- **Word-boundary match, not substring.** `--family qwen` matches
  `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF` / `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF` (the keyword may
  be followed by a version digit, e.g. `qwen2`/`qwen3`) but **never** a different
  family that merely starts with the same letters — `Jackrong/Qwopus…`,
  `empero-ai/Qwythos…`.
- **`--min-trending-score` is ignored in family mode** (a score floor would filter
  a niche family out entirely — most family repos report trendingScore 0). Family
  providers are ranked trendingScore desc with a **downloads desc tie-break**.
- **Degenerate families fail loudly, never silently:** a keyword with **zero**
  matching GGUF repos prints `no GGUF repos found for family '<kw>'` and exits
  non-zero (typo / non-GGUF family); **fewer** providers than `--count` downloads
  what exists and reports honestly (`downloaded N/M`).
- **Transient HF API errors are retried** (this applies to the whole top-tier
  pipeline, trending *and* family). Family mode fans out one HF API call per repo
  tree (hundreds), so the pipeline retries rate-limits / server blips
  (HTTP 429/500/502/503/504 and plain network / socket-timeout errors) with
  bounded exponential backoff that honours `Retry-After`; a **permanent** error
  (401/403/404) is never retried — it fails fast so a genuinely gated/dead repo is
  still reported loudly (the skip+refill and "no repos" paths above). Without this
  retry, a single 429 on one repo tree would silently drop that repo and turn a
  valid match into a false "no model fits".

Without `--family` the command behaves byte-identically to before (all existing
top-tier tests pass unmodified).

---

## Verification, loop & CI (containerized — same everywhere)

Every verification stage runs **inside the test container** so behaviour is
byte-identical on your local host (nerdctl/Colima or docker) and on GitHub
Actions CI. Stages are driven **only through `make`** — the container is never
started directly.

```bash
make loop              # == make loop-harness: run ALL stages in order, GREEN gate
make test-image        # build the test image (python+pytest+deps + CPU llama-server)
make lint              # linefeed/editorconfig lint (fail-closed)
make test-unit         # hermetic unit tests (all files, incl. openspec-tasks-check)
make test-agents-e2e   # REAL agent-spawn e2e: runs ONLY *_e2e*.py — fake worker does README
                       # issue-work, hung worker is killed+respawned (issue #63); <1 min
make test-install      # install tests (run in-container; host-artifact asserts — no skips via test-install-ci)
make test-install-ci   # REAL install tests, NO SKIPS: make install + model + assert in ONE container
make test-install-host # verify the REAL host install: ~/bin/llgenie + symlinks + ~/models (runs on host)
make test-health       # end-to-end CPU LLM check: downloads tiny model, answers "hi"
make test-top-tier     # REAL acceptance (no mocks): live HF trending + fit gate + real download
make test-top-tier-serve  # download a lightweight top-tier model, load llama-server, answer 'hi', check RAM
make test-top-tier-cli-ci # REAL CLI dry-run in the CI container: llgenie --download-top-tier --dry --count 2
make download-test-model  # fetch Qwen2.5-0.5B into ~/models/Qwen/8GB (via `hf` CLI)
make openspec-validate NAME=<change>   # validate an OpenSpec change
make test-clean        # prune stopped orphaned test containers (always)
```

The `make loop` harness runs these stages in order (each in its own `--rm`
container), then **always** prunes orphaned containers:

```
image → download → lint → unit → install → health → top-tier → top-tier-serve → test → openspec → clean
```

- The **`health` stage** is a real end-to-end check: it downloads the
  lightweight `Qwen2.5-0.5B` model and asserts `/health` + a chat "hi" reply
  from the **CPU-built `llama-server`** bundled in the image.
- **`RUNTIME`** defaults to `nerdctl` and resolves to `docker` on non-Colima
  hosts — the same `make` target runs under either engine.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) triggers on every branch/PR and runs each
  stage as its own **parallel** job: `lint`, `unit`, `install`, `openspec`,
  and `cpu-health`. Every job is a `make` command, so CI == your local loop.

### No-fallback rule

The repo has **one** code path per resource, running through the same container
on CI and locally. In particular the model download always uses the official
`hf`(huggingface_hub) CLI (bundled in the test image) — never a `requests`/
`urllib` fallback.

### Local GPU (Metal) verification is mandatory

CI exercises only the **CPU** path (bare runners, no GPU). Before reporting a
change that touches the launcher/health/serving as done, you must also run the
health check against the **host GPU (Metal)** via `~/bin/llgenie` with the
`Qwen/8GB` model and record the reply.

### Self-driving development (background watch loop)

This repository is **self-driving** when its background watch loop is installed
on the host. A `*/20 * * * *` host crontab entry launches a one-shot
`project-manager` Hermes session (cwd = this repo, so `AGENTS.md` loads as its
durable rulebook) that, each tick:

- **Polls PRs + CI first** and merges any PR whose CI is fully green AND has an
  approval AND no open review threads, then cleans up the merged branch — the
  local worktree + local branch + per-worker artifacts **and the REMOTE branch**
  (`git push origin --delete feat/<kebab>`; the merge itself also requests
  `delete_branch: true`, so no stale `origin` branches accumulate after a merge).
- **Drives every open issue to a PR**: for any open issue lacking a live branch/
  PR it creates an isolated git worktree feature branch off `main`
  (`../llgenie-wt/<kebab>`), follows the OpenSpec-first lifecycle
  (change/proposal/spec/tasks first, then implementation), validates, then opens
  a PR against `main` that references the issue.
- **Keeps the issue body, OpenSpec change, and code in sync** (bidirectional,
  continuous).
- **Reclaims only genuinely dead or long-silent workers.** Each worker writes a
  spawn-wrapper heartbeat line to its own `feat-<slug>.log` every
  `WORKER_LOG_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS` (default 5 min) while its hermes child is alive, so
  the loop's liveness check never mistakes a productive-but-slow worker for a hung
  one (`hermes chat` buffers all stdout until it exits — it never streams mid-run).
  A worker is only reclaimed as stuck after its log has been silent for
  `STUCK_LOG_STALE_SECONDS` (default 4 h, far beyond the heartbeat cadence), and a
  worker whose process has exited is reclaimed immediately via the dead-PID path.

The durable rules and the exact crontab entry live in `AGENTS.md` (the
"Background watch loop" section); the loop prompt and its output log are
`.watchloop/prompt.txt` and `.watchloop/watchloop.log` (both gitignored). You can
review past loop runs with `grep 'WATCH-LOOP SUMMARY' .watchloop/watchloop.log`.

This contract is exercised end-to-end by verification issue
[#7](https://github.com/asimov-agent/llgenie/issues/7), which the loop drove to a
real worktree → OpenSpec → code → PR lifecycle on the branch
`feat/test-watchloop-verify-the-background-watch-loop-dr` — proof the loop is not
just documented but actually drives a brand-new issue to a PR.

### Choosing the worker model the loop uses

Each cron-spawned worker is a `project-manager` Hermes session that drives one open
issue to a PR. It uses an LLM whose choice defaults to the local GGUF model
(`llm-local` on `:11434`, good for serving) but is **configurable** so the loop runs
fast when you want it to.

**Where it is set — two places (resolution order, first wins):**

1. **Environment variables** (in the crontab / exported): `WATCHLOOP_WORKER_MODEL`
   and `WATCHLOOP_WORKER_PROVIDER`.
2. **The config file** `.watchloop/run/worker-model` — two lines, line 1 = model id,
   line 2 = provider (blank = profile provider). This is a **local, gitignored** file.

If both are empty, workers use the profile default (`llm-local`).

**How to configure (recommended, uses the template):**

```bash
# copy the versioned template into the live (gitignored) config, then edit it
cp scripts/worker-model.template .watchloop/run/worker-model
```

A built-in template lives at **`scripts/worker-model.template`** (tracked in git) and
documents both options in place:

- **llama.cpp / local GGUF** — set line 1 to `llm-local`, leave line 2 empty. Good
  for offline/private jobs; slower for agentic driving (~170s/call on the 35B).
- **Hosted / OpenRouter (recommended for speed)** — e.g. line 1
  `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731`, line 2 `openrouter`. Makes the autonomous loop
  drive issues to a PR quickly.

The dispatcher reads this at startup and launches each worker with
`hermes chat ... -m <MODEL> --provider <PROVIDER>`. Change the file (or the env vars)
and the next cron tick picks it up.

### Installing / uninstalling the watch loop (macOS + Linux)

The watch loop runs as a host crontab entry (`*/20 * * * *`). Two `make` targets
install and uninstall it idempotently (guarding against duplicates and preserving
your other crontab lines):

```bash
make cron-install      # add the */20 watch-loop entry (idempotent; no-op if already present)
make cron-uninstall    # remove ONLY the watch-loop entry (keeps unrelated lines)
make cron-snapshot     # (via scripts/install_watchloop_cron.py snapshot) preview the entry
```

**Prerequisites before installing:**
1. `make install` (so the launcher, venv, and `~/bin` symlinks exist).
2. (Workers that drive issues need GitHub push access) a working token in `.env`
   (gitignored) — the dispatcher reads `GITHUB_TOKEN` from it at runtime. Never
   commit the token.
3. `python3` on PATH (macOS: the helper falls back to `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`
   if present; Linux: plain `python3`).

**What the entry does** — every 20 min it launches `scripts/watchloop_dispatch.py`
as a `project-manager` Hermes session (`cwd = this repo`, so `AGENTS.md` loads as
its rulebook) that polls PRs/CI, merges ready PRs, and drives every open issue to
a PR. See the "Self-driving development" section above.

**First-tick smoke check** after `make cron-install`:
```bash
crontab -l | grep watchloop_dispatch      # entry present
# wait up to 20 min, then confirm the loop ran:
tail .watchloop/run/dispatch.log          # should show a `tick start` line + activity
```

### Observing the watch loop (`make watch-report`)

To see whether the cron agents are actually working, run the on-demand status
report (host-side, reads the repo's own `.watchloop` logs + live GitHub state):

```bash
make watch-report            # default: last 60 dispatch.log lines
make watch-report WINDOW=200 # wider dispatcher window
```

`make watch-report` is **exercised in CI** by the `watch-report` job, which runs
the real target against a committed fixture `.watchloop` tree + a fake `gh`
shim (no real loop data, token, or network) and fails if any report section is
missing or the command errors.

It answers three questions:

1. **What work did the cron agents do?** — each worker session found in
   `.watchloop/logs` is listed with its issue, PR, branch, heartbeat count, and
   a "what this tick did" snippet when the log carries a `STATUS: DONE` /
   `WATCH-LOOP SUMMARY` block. Live workers (heartbeat within the last 40 min)
   are shown separately from STALE/DONE logs, so a leftover log from a finished
   branch is never mistaken for an active worker.
2. **What is the output rate?** — live open issues + open PRs with each PR's
   merge-state, review decision, and compact CI verdict; plus the dispatcher
   timeline (spawn / repair / merge-wait / clean / tick counts in the window)
   and a tick-start-vs-tick-done balance check that flags a possible doubled or
   incomplete run.
3. **How does it react to red CI?** — repair-stage action count in the window
   plus any open PR currently showing failing CI (the PRs the repair stage is
   expected to fix).

**Per-OS notes:**
- macOS: cron uses a minimal PATH; the entry prefixes
  `/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`. If you use a
  custom python, `make cron-install PYTHON=/path/to/python3`.
- Linux (systemd-cron / vixie-cron): the same cron syntax applies; the entry uses
  plain `python3` from your cron PATH. If `cron` isn't running: `sudo systemctl
  enable --now cron` / `sudo service cron start`.

**To remove the loop entirely:** `make cron-uninstall`.
