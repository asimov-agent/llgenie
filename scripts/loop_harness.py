"""Basic loop harness for llgenie.

Runs the verification stages in a fixed order and fails closed: if any stage
exits non-zero, the remaining stages still run (to report all failures) but the
final exit code is non-zero.

Stages (order matters):
    0. image    — build the containerized test image              -> make test-image
    1. download — ensure the lightweight health-test model exists -> make download-test-model
    2. lint     — every tracked text file ends with a newline     -> make lint
    2b. agents-read — AGENTS.md must not match Hermes threat patterns -> make test-agents-read
    3. unit     — hermetic unit tests                             -> make test-unit
    4. install  — verify make install artifacts (host: ~/bin ll...)
    5. health   — launch tiny model, answer 'hi' on endpoint      -> make test-health
    6. test     — full fast suite                                 -> make test
    7. openspec — validate the active OpenSpec change             -> make openspec-validate NAME=<active>
    8. clean    — remove orphaned test containers                 -> make test-clean

All stages run through make, each in its own `--rm` container (so `download`
and `health` both fetch the model fresh into the container's /root/models). Usage:
    python3 scripts/loop_harness.py            # auto-detect active change
    python3 scripts/loop_harness.py NAME=<chg> # validate a specific change
    make loop                                  # equivalent wrapper
