"""Hermetic e2e tests for the stall-watch fix in scripts/hf_download.py (issue #55).

NO MOCKS: each test drives the REAL hf_download.main() as a subprocess against a REAL
fake-`hf` executable (tests/fixtures/fake_hf.py) that is a genuine child process
writing real bytes to a real temp dir. `tree_bytes` reads the real disk. The stall
threshold and poll interval are shrunk via env (HF_STALL_SECONDS / HF_POLL_SECONDS)
so the runs finish fast; production defaults stay at 90s / 3s.
