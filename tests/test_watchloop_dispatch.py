"""Hermetic unit tests for scripts/watchloop_dispatch.py.

These test the three reliability guarantees that issue #18 covers:
  1. stale-lock auto-clean: a `.running` lock whose recorded PID is dead is
     removed and a worker is (re)spawned; a live PID suppresses spawn.
  2. same-tick resolved-issue skip: the merge gate returns the issue numbers it
     closed this tick, and `main` skips spawning those.
  3. the shared `closing_issues` / `pid_alive` helpers used across the logic.

All tests are hermetic: no GitHub API calls and no real worker processes. We stub
the module's `api()`/`log()`/`subprocess.Popen`/`ensure_worktree` and only exercise
pure control flow.
