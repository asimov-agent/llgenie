"""Host end-to-end health check for llgenie.

Part of the loop harness (`make loop` -> `health` stage). Verifies the
installed entry point works by actually running a model and answering a prompt:

  1. locate the lightweight test model under ~/models (it must already be
     downloaded into the right GPU tier — run `make download-test-model`);
  2. launch `$HOME/bin/llgenie` (the installed launcher) on a random high port
     so it never clashes with a user server already on 11434;
  3. poll GET /health until the server reports ready;
  4. POST a prompt ("hi") to /v1/chat/completions and assert we get a text
     completion back => the serving endpoint is healthy end-to-end.

Skips cleanly (does not error) if the model or llama-server is absent, so the
loop stays green on a host that has not downloaded the test model yet.
